# Software Processes Part II
## CS4003 - Software Engineering
Justin A. Dang

___

# Design and Analysis
A **requirements document** serves as a foundation for a project. It defines the general aspects of design, specification, and resource analysis. 
- Requirements elicitation and analysis
- Requirements specifications/validation
- System Description
- User and system requirements


---

# Diagrams
Diagrams help define processes and models how systems and objects work in the project. 
- Can be added to the requirements document as an addendum

---

# Software Specification
Establishes serves required and constraints put on development. 
- What do the system stakeholders require or expect from the system?


---

# Design Activities
-  Architectural design
- Database design
- Interface design
- Component selection and design

---

# Old Systems Design
- Design, code, implement in linear fashion
- Testing done in between processes


---

# Agile, Lean, New School Paradigms
- Design, code, implement in sections
- Integrate and integrate over a given timeline
- Tasks split up into teams and groups
- Prioritizes testing in all stages



---

# Validation
Verification and validation (V&V) shows a system works as it should.
- Does the system conform to specifications?
- Does it meet the needs of the system customer?

Testing is most common method.

--- 

# Software evolution
Software should be flexible and able to change. Good software can adapt to changing circumstances and can be easily maintainable.
- Will my software work and evolve in 2 years time? 5 years?
- Will the tools and processes remain relevant over time?

---

# Process measurement
Quantitative process data is useful to measure the progress of a project.
- Measurements can help look at where you are, but shouldn't drive improvements

Shows users (actors) and all the processes that they have access to.
- Admin &rarr; Create/update work order, create/update user
- Worker &rarr; Accept work order, view work order
