Justin A. Dang

___

# Systems Modeling
System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system. 



___
# Types of System Models
- Context models
- Interaction models
- Structural models
- Behavioral models
- Model-driven engineering 

___

# Sequence Diagram
Sequence diagrams are part of the UML and are used to model the interactions between the actors and the objects within a system.

___

# Designing Sequence Diagrams
- Design based on actor in a linear fashion (left to right)
- Show interaction of objects based on data and application
- Layer classifiers

___

# Requirements Engineering
- User requirements
- System requirements

___
# User Requirements
- Statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints. Written for customers.

___

# Systems Requirements
- More technical literature that defines things like the tech stack. Written for developers.

___

# Functional vs non-functional requirements
- Functional statements are statements of services the system should provide.
- Non-functional statements are constraints on the services of functions offered such as timing constraints. It's not based on state but rather processing.

___

# Metrics for specifying nonfunctional requirements
- Speed
- Size
- Ease of use
- Reliability
- Robustness
- Portability

___

# Requirements processes
- Elicitation
- Analysis
- Validation
- Management

In practice, the processes are an iterative activity in which these processes are interleaved.
